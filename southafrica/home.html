<h2>The Sardine Run</h2>
<p>The Sardine Run is an annual reoccurring phenomenon on the East Coast of South Africa. During June and July, the sardines
    migrate from the Agulhas Bank to the coast of KwaZulu-Natal following the cold Benguela Counter Current. There are billions of
    fish creating shoals of kilometres/miles long. This spectacular event leads whales, dolphins, sharks, sea birds and sometimes
    even seals into a feeding frenzy. They round up the fish into a bait ball and start eating them, dozens at the time…</p>

    <p>As a diver, we can go and spot this massacre. Of course, it’s not easy-peasy. You must have good buoyancy as you are diving
    in the blue. You also may not fear the sharks and whales and have a thick enough wetsuit as the temperature is only around
    20C/68F.</p>
<p>The Sardine Run is not cheap, 4000 dollars and more. Spotter planes are needed to go and check where the fish are. When found,
    everybody goes into a RIB and takes off to see the damage done from close.</p>
<p>Even though this is a very expensive trip, it is not guaranteed you’ll see the Sardine Run in great numbers. It depends from
    year to year how massive it is. Overfishing and climate change for sure don’t help.</p>
<p>This is a bucket list dive for every avid diver or underwater photographer. Sadly enough, I couldn’t go yet.</p>
