<h2>Fiji</h2>
<p>Fiji is an island country in the South Pacific. It is an archipelago with more than 330 islands and 500 islets. The two major
    islands are Viti Levu, with the capital Suva, and Vanua Levu who account for 87% of the population. Divers choose to
    go on a liveaboard and dive as much as possible or choose one island and day trip scuba. There are more than enough dive
    resorts and ecolodges to find on the white sandy beaches spread over the several islands. The best ones for diving are
    Taveuni, Kadavu, Viti Levu and the Beqa lagoon.</p>

<p>You can dive Fiji the whole year round. In between April and October, in winter, there is lesser rain and visibility can
    be superb but the water temperatures are also colder, arond 24C/75F. In summer, from November till March, the sea water
    is much warmer, 30C/86F. On the other hand, the vis goes down because of the rain run-off and you risk having a cyclone
    coming over.</p>
<p>Around Taveuni, the third biggest island, you will find the Somosomo strait running between the island and Vanua Levu. In
    the strait are two famous Fijian dive sites: The Great White Wall and Rainbow Reef. Along you find great corals blooms,
    tunnels and plenty of pelagics cruising in the funky currents. Expect to drift dive while looking at soft corals or gorgonians,
    barracudas, different reef sharks and mantas.</p>
<p>Kadavu, Fiji’s fourth biggest island, is home to the Great Astrolabe Reef, a 100km/62mi long barrier reef. The dive sites
    on this reef are easier to dive for novices. There is lesser current and easy access from a short boat ride. There are
    plenty of soft and hard coral gardens, walls, pinnacles and manta cleaning stations. Although the Great Astrolabe Reef
    is becoming more and more popular -it is the fourth largest barrier reef in the world- it is still lesser visited, lesser
    commercialised and more laidback. You’ll find less big resorts and more in-tune eco lodges.</p>

<p>Viti Levu is the main island of Fiji. It has one of the best shark dives of the world! On Shark Reef, just offshore of Pacific
    Harbour, Beqa Adventures takes you out to dive with 8 different types of sharks. You’ll be confronted with tawny nurse
    sharks, whitetip, blacktip and grey reef sharks, sicklefin lemon sharks, silvertips, bull sharks AND tiger sharks. The
    trip includes two dives without cages where sharks will be fed by the guides. Sharks are predators, there a lot of rules
    for going and no novices are allowed. Also shark chumming has stirred up many discussions but, as for now, no injuries
    had been called upon and now ban has been asked for. So… just be ready for a once in a lifetime experience!
    <br>If you don’t want to deal with the apex predators, then you can go and explore the waters from Rakiraki, in the north
    of Viti Levu. The strait in between Viti Levu and Vanau Levu is called the Bligh Water, named after the captain of the
    Bounty. This stretch of sea can have ripping currents, giving food to all the colourful corals and being playgrounds
    for all the fish. Drift diving is the key, although there are also protected sites for novices.</p>
<p>Just south of Viti Levu lies Beqa Island. You can stay on the island or dive the sites from the main island itself. The lagoon
    is one of the most popular destinations in Fiji. All level divers can go here. The lagoon is protected by a barrier reef
    so there are only gentle currents.</p>
