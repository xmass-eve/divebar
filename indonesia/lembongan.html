<h3>Nusa Lembongan and Nusa Penida</h3>
<p>Nusa Lembongan and Nusa Penida are two famous dive islands situated in the Lombok Channel, east of Bali. People used to stay
    on Lembongan and went from there on to the dive spots. Lately, I heard, you can also stay on Penida but the regime will
    be the same. Anyway, the dive tours are always two-tank trips: leaving in the morning, back by early afternoon. In the
    afternoon, there can also be a close by one-tank trip</p>

<p>The corals around the islands are beautiful because there are still not that many divers and because the water temperatures
    are colder than on the next-door Gilis. They go from 19C/66F to 27C/80F. Currents can be kinda strong so be aware. There
    is also a known down current at the Crystal Bay dive site. People have gone lost and died there so stay behind your guide!</p>
<p>The islands are famous because there are two manta cleaning stations (Manta Bay and Secret Manta) and in the right time of
    year, from July to mid-November, there is a fair chance to see a Mola Mola or Ocean Sunfish.</p>
<p>I recommend beginners to follow the Open Water Certification (and maybe their advanced too) in the Gilis and then fun dive
    Lembongan. You`ll already be used to the currents and depths at that point.<br/>Lots of Balinese dive centers take you
    over on a day tour to Manta Bay and Crystal Bay. If you do have the time, go and stay on Lembongan instead. You`ll have
    dive guides that know the sites so much better and you`ll dive the sites on less crowded hours. The dive schools are
    also more professional on the islands.</p>
<p>I recommend to dive with Two Fish, Big Fish or Blue Corner. Make sure you book in advanced as all the dive schools are not
    that big. Also be aware that on the holy day of Nyepi, there is no diving allowed. Nothing is allowed on Lembongan, Penida
    and Bali. The summer months are the busiest months. During rainy season, you`ll almost be alone. In my opinion, the best
    time to go is May/June and September/October.</p>
