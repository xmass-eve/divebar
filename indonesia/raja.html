<h3>Raja Ampat, West-Papua</h3>
            <p>Raja Ampat, Four Kings in Indonesian, is an area in West-Papua. As the name says, it consists of four big islands with lots of smaller ones around. Raja used to be a dive paradise for the people that wanted to spend time and money to get there and stay there. Lately, you can go for cheap(er) and day dives are planned with the more and more homestays build on the islands. All kind of tourists and companies find their way to this superior place so try to enjoy while you still can! The mass tourism became already this bad that in beginning 2017 the cruise ship MS Caledonian Sky from Noble Caledonia Cruises simply rammed a reef and the captain couldn’t care less! </p>
            <p>As the local people of Papua know they are living in a very important environmental place, they try to protect it as much as they can and every tourist must pay a Marine Park Entry Permit. Part of this money is used to protect the reefs and catch illegal fishing ships. The last years, the amount was 1.000.000 IDR and the permit counts for 1 year.</p>

            <p>Most divers go on liveaboards. You fly to Sorong, West-Papua and you’ll be picked up by your diving company. Depending on the time of the year and the direction of the wind, you’ll go to the North (Wayag islands!) or the South (Missool!). You can’t do both, as sad as it is… It is to far away…</p>
            <p>Whichever direction you will go, you will still dive the Dampier Strait. Water comes from a nutrient rich deep ocean up to the very shallow strait, bringing thousands of fish (fusiliers, tuna, barracuda, sharks), whales and dolphins. The diving is amazing but be aware of the currents!</p>
            <p>Because of the booming tourism, more and more homestays are built on the islands close to Waisai, the Raja Ampat Capital on Waigeo island. To get there, you take the ferry from Sorong to Waisai. There you’ll be picked up by boat or car, depending on the place of your homestay.  Your day dives will be around the Dampier strait. Maybe, if you are lucky, they’ll bring you as far as Arborek Island so you can dive Manta Sandy.</p>
            <p>Raja is still not that cheap and you still need to take your time to get there and away. In high season, you also need to book far in advance to get a spot on the boat or a room in the homestays. Bring what you need from Sorong (alcohol, candy, medicine) because you won’t find it on the islands. </p>
            <p>The homestays are open the whole year through. Liveaboards are more around from September till April as they change with the Komodo high season (April-September). </p>
