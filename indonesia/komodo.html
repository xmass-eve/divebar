 <h3>Komodo</h3>
            <p>Everybody has heard about the fiery Komodo dragons and would like to go and see them. As divers, we are lucky, as Komodo is not only a fairy-tale place with its monstrous creatures, but also a divers paradise! And… if you’re visiting the Komodo National Park on a liveaboard, you’ll probably have the chance to see both.</p>
            <p>First: if you want to dive the Komodo NP, you fly to Labuan Bajo, Flores and not to the Komodo island itself. All boats leave from there, dayboats and liveaboards. </p>

            <p>As the park is really big, I don’t recommend doing daytrips. You can, but you will be driving for hours until you are where you want to be. It is much nicer to spend some time on a liveaboard, where you go into the park for multiple days and nights. In the evening, you go and enjoy beautiful sunsets on the inhabited islands before the voluntary night dive. In the early morning, you wake up for a sunrise dive and the big breakfast afterwards, followed by more dives and more food. Like this, you can do up to 4 dives a day. Not bad for its price!</p>
            <p>Komodo has great dive sites with lots of stuff to see: it has plenty of pelagics. There are lots of mantas, white, black and grey tip reef sharks and the occasional dolphin (We had some humpback whales to while being there! I just don’t think they are that common). On the other hand, you can go and spot some nice nudibranchs and big schools of fish too.</p>
            <p>Komodo is suited for all types of divers, and courses are given, but be aware of the currents. They can be fast and go up or down before you realise, so stay behind the guide and bring an SMB and reef hook.</p>
            <p>If you love currents, go with the Current Junkies. They are spot on time when currents will be strong but safe and you`ll see tons of mantas or sharks. They are not suited for open water divers. You do need to have enough of experience to join their precious boat.</p>
            <p> you want it more relaxed, check out the normal liveaboards. Still currents can always be around so be aware. My choice of liveaboard is Wicked Diving. They have a boat that goes around the park for 3 or 6 days (Jaya) and one that is used as a floating hotel so you can stay as long if you like (CB). Other good dive centres are Blue Marlin or Divine Diving. Choose a good and safe dive centre. I have heard bad stories about some day dive centres.</p>
            <p>You can dive in Komodo the whole year round, but lots of liveaboards tend to go to Raja Ampat from November till April. This means that between April and October there is more choice in choosing a good boat…</p>
