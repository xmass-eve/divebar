<h3>Bali</h3>
            <p>Bali is the most popular Indonesian island. It gathers lots of tourists, surfers and of course, divers. It is
                for sure not the best place to go diving in this country but it is the cheapest one to get to. So there you
                have the reason for the massive amount of foreigners.</p>

            <p>There are two big dive areas: east-Bali with Padangbai and Amed/Tulamben, and west-Bali with Permuteran. People
                that go to Bali on a diving trip, go and stay in these areas but you can also do a day trip to the eastern
                dive sites out of Kuta or Sanur. It will just take you a very long ride in the car.</p>
            <p>Amed/Tulamben has the most famous dive spot of Indonesia as it has the Liberty Wreck lying there. The USAT Liberty
                has been torpedoed in 1942 by a Japanese submarine and now lies in very shallow waters. Everybody can dive
                the wreck, your depth depending on your level. Even snorkelers can go and take a look.<br/>Because of this
                limited depth, is it a very popular site. Try to go on different hours, like sunrise or sunset. When you
                are lucky, you will also see the big schools of bumpheads. If you can't find them at the wreck, try to dive
                the Drop Off as a second dive.</p>
            <p>If you stay in the Amed area, you can also go a little bit more to the south and dive around Padangbai. They`ll
                take you to big rocks, like Gili Tepekong, and you'll dive there. Of course this will be a day trip as
                traffic and roads in Bali aren't great.</p>
            <p>Diving around Permuteran will give you another type of creatures. The west has more the macro-diving of the island.
                If you wanna see seahorses, this is the place to be.</p>
            <p>Bali is a year-round destination but bear in mind that there is a sunny season (May-October) and a rainy season
                (November-April). As we get wet while diving, it should't really matter for us but I get people like the
                sun more. Me too, by the way.<br>In July and August, the island is packed. I wouldn't recommend to go in
                that period if you could avoid it. May or Oktober are much better. Bali celebrates the holy day of Nyepi
                in march. Check beforehand when the day will fall as there is nothing allowed on this day of silence. You
                don't want to wake up bad spirits, do you?</p>
