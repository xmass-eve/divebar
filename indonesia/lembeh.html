<h3>Lembeh Strait, North-Sulawesi</h3>
            <p>When my students asked me which place in the world I liked best for diving, then the Lembeh Strait always came up as a 5* for muck and macro diving. I simply love this place! Though I can understand that people who don’t have an appetite for the small critters, will feel bored as hell as there is no big stuff to be found. </p>
            <p>No, Lembeh is home to a very special fauna and flora with lots of endemic species and other tiny animals, all to be found on the slower than slow diving over black lava sand. Pygmy seahorses, hairy frogfish, mandarinfish, velvetfish, mimic octopus, wonderpus, flamboyant cuttlefish, bobtail squid, ghostpipe fish, … I can keep on naming all the fantastic cuties I saw but then I would be busy for another half an hour! You need to go and check for yourself. You’ll be amazed!</p>

            <p>Of course, Lembeh is a great place for avid photographers. Please, be aware of your surroundings and the other divers when taking pictures. Not only is it very impolite and selfish to not let other divers take a picture too, but it is also very easy to destroy the area and even dangerous when you don’t look out and put yourself on the common poisonous fish. Everyone will need to watch a small video, sign a form and then keep themselves to behaving ok. The frog kick is -of course- the recommended way of diving.</p>
            <p>As Lembeh is all about muck diving, there is no necessity to go deep. Lots is found in the above 25-30m/80-100ft. There is also no current and water temperatures are warm. If allowed, you can spend more than an hour on every site.</p>
            <p>When going to Lembeh, you fly to Manado on North-Sulawesi. Most of the dive centers will come to pick you up and bring you to Bitung by car. From there on, you will be brought by boat to the chosen dive resort. We dove with Two Fish and I enjoyed it lots!</p>
            <p>Some Lembeh dive centers (like Two Fish or Froggies Divers) have another dive center in Bunaken, an island closer to Manado. If you decide to dive both, there will be package deals available. </p>
