<h3>Gili Islands</h3>
<p>Gili Trawangan, Gili Air and Gili Meno are three little islands in the Lombok Channel, between Bali and Lombok. They are
    easy reachable by fast boat. The Gilis are in my opinion one of the best places around the world to do courses. It's
    an ideal place to start your Open Water Certificate, up to finishing your skills and becoming a dive master or dive Instructor.
    There is the choice to go to a PADI school or an SSI school. Lately, there are more and more dive schools teaching sidemount
    and technical diving too.</p>

<p>The water around the Gilis has a clear visibility up to 30 metres/100 feet. The temperatures are warm, between 27C/80F and
    30C/86F and the conditions go from no current to a slight medium. The best weather on the islands is from may tot beginning
    november. But do bear in mind that in july and august the islands will be packed with tourists! Check the month of Ramadhan
    before you go! Not that the fasting will effect the diving much, it will be more the daily life after.</p>
<p>You choose an island on what you want to do in the evening. Gili Trawangan has lots of bars and restaurants, Gili Meno has
    only a few, and Gili Air is hanging in between. We always say that party people and the backpackers are best of on Gili
    Trawangan, honeymooners should go to Gili Meno, as their is nothing to do, and people with kids can find their way on
    Gili Air.</p>
<p>When choosing a dive school, go to Manta Dive on Gili Air or Gili Trawangan. It is one of the oldest dive schools around
    and there is always lots of fun. Even the Loney Planet agrees on that one! They have lots of instructors who speak lots
    of different languages. Almost everybody is trained on the island itself so they know the places and conditions by heart.<br>    If you are looking for the technical site of diving, then I do recommend to go to Blue Marlin Dive on Gili Trawangan.
    They have the most experience and the best instructors. Do choose your dive school well, as not everybody is part of
    the GIDA (Gili Island Divers Association). Schools that aren't in the GIDA are more likely to take no notice of safety
    regulations.

<p>Diving around the Gili islands is a great experience! Don't expect the big stuff constantly passing by -that doesn't happen
    everywhere in the world- but sharks and the occasional manta are around. What you will see tons of for sure, are turtles!
    Hawksbills and green turtles are everywhere around the three islands. Some divespots, like deeper Meno Wall or Air Wall,
    tend to have more nudibranchs than the other dive sites.</p>
