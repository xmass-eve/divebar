<h3>Bunaken </h3>
            <p>Truth to be told, I have never been to Bunaken. The reason why this place shows on the list, is that Bunaken is lots of times combined with the Lembeh Strait. Some dive centers, like Two Fish and Froggies Divers, have accommodation in both places and give out package deals.
            This combination is often made because of the opposites in fauna and flora. The muck diving happens in Lembeh, the bigger stuff you find in Bunaken. </p>
            <p>Bunaken is an island on North-Sulawesi. You fly to Manado and there you will be picked up by your dive center.</p>
