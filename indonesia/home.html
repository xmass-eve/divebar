<h2>
    Indonesia, the land of the many</h2>
<p>I’ll be honest: I am extremely biased about Indonesia. I have worked several years in this dive paradise so I had lots of
    time to go and explore a certain amount of the 17.500 islands in this country.

    <p>To start with, Indonesia lies in the coral triangle. The Pacific Ocean comes from the east, bringing it’s warm water.
        The Indian Ocean touches the west side with its colder waters. Because of these two oceans, there is a big change
        of nutrients and water making it very good for corals to grow and fish to flow.
        <br>On the other hand, it can also deliver strong currents. Depending on where you go, you should be aware that bringing
        a reef hook maybe isn’t a bad idea…</p>
    <p>Indonesia is big! It will take some time to get where you need to be. Make sure you plan good in advance. The domestic
        flights aren’t always on time (ahum ahum). Try to avoid Surabaya airport (delays) and Lion Air/Wings air (delays
        and a weird transit system). Pay some more money and fly Garuda.</p>
    <p>Indonesia is the biggest Muslim country in the world. You won’t notice in Bali but if you go diving somewhere else, check
        the dates for Ramadhan. The dive regime is changed or diving is suspended for a day. If you go diving in Bali, be
        aware of Nyepi. No diving, no sound, no anything is allowed that day!</p>
