<h3>Lombok</h3>
            <p>Lombok has two dive areas: The South around Belongas with its famous site ‘The Magnet’ and then the Southwest around Sekotong. They are both very different!</p>
            <p>Let’s start with the South! ‘The Magnet’ is a world-famous dive pinnacle for spotting hammerhead sharks. They aren’t there the whole time of the year, sadly enough, but come from July till November. If none of these beauties are around, there is still a big chance to spot some white tip reef sharks or mobulas.</p>

            <p>Be aware: this is not a spot for baby divers. There can be really strong down currents and a massive swell that throws you against the pinnacle! People have died or have come up with bruises and scratches all over. Therefore, not everybody is allowed to go. If you don’t have at least 100 dives and a deep certification, you can’t come. Check before booking your trip.</p>
            <p>Most of the times ‘The Magnet’ is a combined day trip with ‘The Cathedral’, another, lots safer, pinnacle. From friends, I heard ‘The Cathedral’ is sometimes overfull with banded and olive sea snakes… </p>
            <p>There are not many dive centres that go on these trips. Last I heard (end 2016), only Two Fish (the old Dive Zone) went for sure. If you would be around, diving on the Gilis or Southwest Lombok, ask your local dive center to help you out. Trips must be booked in advanced and be aware of shabby deals.</p>
            <p>The other diving area on Lombok is around Sekotong and all the little islands around, like Gili Gede and Gili Asahan. This is completely different diving! You come to this area for the macro and muck diving. I found tons of different nudibranchs and seahorses, harlequin shrimps and bamboo sharks. Compared to the close by Gili Trawangan, Air and Meno, the water is less clear: Visibility goes from 5m/16ft till 15m/50ft. Water temperatures are the same though, reaching from 26C/79F till 30C/86F.</p>
            <p>Lately, with tourism more booming in Lombok, there are more and more dive centers. Some are on the mainland, like Odyssea Divers and Two fish, others are starting on Gili Gede and Gili Asahan. </p>
            <p>If you are staying in Sengiggi, you’ll find dozens of dive centers too. They all go diving around the Gili Islands, so if you’re on a real diving trip, go and stay over there instead.</p>
            <p>Be aware that Lombok is muslim so the island will celebrate Ramadhan and Idul Fitri. Dive times will change because of those holy days. Check the dates before you go! They are different every year.</p>
