<h2>Andaman Islands</h2>
<p>The Andamans Islands, in the Bay of Bengal, belong to India. They are remote islands and are lesser visited. There are several
    dive resorts on the islands, so day diving is possible. Most of them are on Havelock Island. I have heard that this island
    is the best for diving anyway. I haven’t had the change yet to go and visit myself. But I wouldn’t mind going on a liveaboard and dive the underwater
    volcano at Barren Island too!</p>
<p>The Andaman Islands get the monsoon from May until October. Diving won’t be great and liveaboards won’t run. There is too
    much rain and wind, seas are too choppy and dive sites won’t be protected. The best time of the year is from November
    till early May.
    <br>You fly onto Port Blair, the little capital of the islands, where your liveaboard or your dive resort will pick you
    up</p>
