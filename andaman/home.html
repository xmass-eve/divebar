<h2>Andaman Islands</h2>
<p>The Andamans in the Bay of Bengal, belong to India. They are kinda remote and are lesser visited. There are several dive
    resorts on the islands, so day diving is possible. Most of them are on Havelock Island. You can also take a liveaboard
    and enjoy a longer trip further away. I have heard that Havelock Island is the best for diving (I haven’t had the change
    yet to go and visit myself) but I wouldn’t mind diving the underwater volcano at Barren Island too!</p>
<p>The Andaman Islands get the monsoon from May until October. Diving won’t be great and liveaboards won’t run. There is too
    much rain and wind, seas are too choppy and dive sites won’t be protected. The best time of the year is from November till early
    May.<br>You fly onto Port Blair, the little capital of the islands, where your liveaboard or your dive resort will pick you up</p>
