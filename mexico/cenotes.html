<h2>The Cenotes</h2>
<p>If you want to dive the cenotes, you’ll have to go to the Playa Del Carmen and Tulum area on the Yucatan Peninsula, East
    Mexico. The Cenotes are natural pits, formed when the limestone bedrock collapsed. Now these sinkholes form beautiful
    sinkholes with crystal clear waters and sometimes kilometres/miles of underwater cave systems.</p>

<p>The cenotes have some of the best visibility in the world, sometimes more than 100m/330ft. People can even get vertigo from
    it. The rainwater that comes in, is so much filtered before it reaches the pit, that there are no more particles disolved
    in it. Only when divers kick up the silt from the bottom, the great vis is disturbed. So, dive carefully and don’t ruin
    it!
    <br>Sometimes, when the cenotes are closer to the coast and when they are connected to the sea through a cave system,
    you may encounter a mirroring halocline where the saline water reaches the fresh water.
    <br>Water temperature in the cenotes is around 24C/75F.</p>
<p>There are thousands of cenotes but not all of them are completely explored. Regular divers, so not the cave divers, can enter
    around 15 of them. One of the most popular is Dos Ojos. These are two cenotes connected by a cave. The diving isn’t that
    deep(10m/33ft) so there will be a good number of snorkelers too. Still, it is beautiful when all the sunlight comes down
    the holes in the ceiling. One of Dos Ojos is called the Bat Cave. Guess which animals fly around in there?
