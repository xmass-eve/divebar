<h2>cozumel</h2>
<p>Cozumel is an island in the Caribbean Sea, East of the Yucatan Peninsula. It is the biggest Mexican island, right in front
    of Playa Del Carmen. To reach it, you take the ferry from PDC or you fly from Cancun or Mexico City. In the summer months,
    there are international flights landing on the Cozumel airstrip.</p>

<p>Half of the Cozumel tourists are divers and/or snorkelers. The rest are sunseekers or cruise ship passengers. Most of the
    tourists come in the summer months and on spring break. If you can, visit Cozumel some other time. Also, the island is
    in the hurricane path. In September and October, you have the most chance your diving will be limited or cancelled due
    to tropical storms.
    <br>Water temperatures are good all year round, between 26C/78F and 30C/86F. Visibility is always around 30m/100ft</p>
<p>Cozumel lies on the second biggest barrier reef of the world, the Meso-American barrier reef. Most of the dive sites will
    be in the Cozumel Reefs National Marine Park and you’ll find plenty of fish and beautiful coral. For sure, check for
    the endemic toadfish and different turtles!
    <br>The island has great diving for all types of divers. There are protected bays with no current for the novices, funky
    drift dives for thrill seekers, steep walls full of colourful coral and sponges, nurse sharks and eagle rays and finally
    the must-do Devils Throat cave dive.</p>
<p>There are lots of dive centers on Cozumel so it’s difficult to find one out of the blue. I recommend Deep Blue Cozumel. First,
    they dive in smaller groups, what is always nice. And second, they will fulfil all your diving needs. You ask, they deliver!</p>
