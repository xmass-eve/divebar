<h2>Mexico</h2>
<p>Mexico is a big country in the south of North America. It has been visited by tourists for a long time. They come to see
    the Mesoamerican cultural sites, they spend time on the beach and they come to dive.
    <br>Mexico is touched by the sea on two sides. On the east, you have the Gulf of Mexico and the Caribbean Sea. On the
    west, there is the Sea of Cortez/Baja California and the Pacific Ocean. They are different. On the East, you have the
    warm waters and the colourful reef fish. It is nice for doing your first courses around the Riviera Maya. The West will
    give you the big and scary pelagics while diving in colder waters. This is more for the experienced divers unless if
    you go to Puerto Vallarta.</p>
