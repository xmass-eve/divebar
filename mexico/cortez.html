<h2>Sea of Cortez/ Baja California</h2>
<p>The Sea of Cortez or the Baja California is a marginal sea between the Baja California Peninsula and the Mexican Mainland.
    The sea is 1126km/700mi long and covers 160.000 km2/62.000sq mi. It is home to an unique and rich marine ecosystem. There
    are the different types of whales, like the Humpbacks, Pilot Whales, Grey Whales, Blue Whales, Fin Whales and Bottlenose
    Dolphins. You can see Hammerheads, Whale Sharks or the endemic Mexican Horn Shark. Sea Lions are very common and numerous
    at Los Islotes, La Paz. And as last, there are the Manta Rays and Mobulas. The whales and whale sharks are only to snorkel
    with. You aren’t allowed to dive with them but you never know they just show up on the dive.</p>

<p>You can dive the Sea of Cortez the whole year through but different times of the year will give different animal sightings.
    The best time for visibility and calm seas is between July and December, although there can be the run-off from a hurricane.
    September and October bring in the Whale Sharks. From December to June, there is more wind and visibility is less because
    of plankton blooms. The advantage is that this does give more sightings of Mobulas and Whales.
    <br>The water temperatures range between 18C/65F in winter and 30C/86F in summer.</p>
<p>The Cortez Sea is dived from on a liveaboard, or you go day diving from 3 destinations: Loretto, La Paz or Los Cabos down
    South. From Cabo San Lucas, you can also take a liveaboard to another great diving destination, the Socorro Islands.</p>
<p>Sadly enough, the encounters with big groups of Hammerheads and other fish are becoming less and less normal. Even though
    significant areas in the Sea of Cortez are part of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites, there is lots of overfishing. The
    Mexican government tries to help and tries to create new parks. The local government and the fisheries don’t care. Money
    comes first…</p>
