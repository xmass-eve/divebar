<h2>Isla Guadalupe</h2>

<p>All the dives done, are cage dives. No need to bring fins… Although some liveaboards let you out of the cage. If you dare
    of course! There are also no dive sites. Cages are lowered in the water and the sharks show up. It’s even not needed
    to chum them. They are just there. It’s a terrific place for taking pictures. The visibility reaches up to 45m/150ft.
    <br>The shark season is from July till November. The seas are calmest at that time. Water temperatures are between 18C/65F
    and 23C/75F.</p>
<p>Apart from the Great whites, you may also encounter fur seals, dolphins and tunas around the island. On the way over, there
    is a good chance to spot different types of whales, mantas, dolphins and lots of seabirds.</p>
