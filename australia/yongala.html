<h2>SS Yongala</h2>
<p>The SS Yongala sank on March 23, 1911. Itâ€™s final resting place is now south of Townsville, Queensland, Australia. It is one of the must-do diving wreck of the world.</p>
<p>The Yongala was a passenger and freight steamer. On her final trip, she was sailing from Mackay to Townsville with 49 passengers, 73 crew and 617 tons of cargo. She was caught in a cyclone and sank with all and everything on board. Nobody knew she sank because the port authorities thought she was hiding for the storm. Only days later, when parts of the wreckage started showing up ashore, they knew something was wrong. But then it was too late. The ship itself was only found back in 1958. Since then, it has become a very popular dive site for the experienced diver.</p>

<p>The ship lies on a sandy bottom around 30m/100ft deep. The shallowest part is at 16m/52ft. The whole length is 109m/358ft. While being there for so long, the Yongala became an artificial reef with sea snakes, bat fish, lion fish, barracudas, rays and bull sharks cruising around. From June to November, you can spot Humpbacks and Minke Whales on the surface.
    <br>The current around the wreck can be fierce so you should know what you are doing.</p>
<p>Diving the SS Yongala can be done on day trips from Townsville, QLD or Ayr, QLD. Entering in the ship is forbidden.</p>
