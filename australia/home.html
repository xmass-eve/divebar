<h2>Australia</h2>
<p>The Commonwealth of Australia is the largest island of Oceania. It consists of mainland Australia, Tasmania and some smaller
    islands. It is the sixth-largest country in the whole world and has the sixth-longest coastline of the world. Australia
    is surrounded by 35.877km/22.293mi of water, part of it the Indian and the Pacific Ocean, the Timor Sea, Arafura Sea,
    Coral Sea and Tasman Sea. </p>
<p>Australia is home to the most famous reef of the world: The Great Barrier Reef! Because of its fame, it attracts lots of
    tourists: snorkelers, divers, day boats and liveaboardsâ€¦ It is very busy. In the GBR, you can also find one of the most
    famous wrecks of the world: the SS Yongala, a passenger and freight steamer that sunk in 1911.
    <br>If you want to have calmer dives with lesser people, you can go and visit Ningaloo Reef instead. It is on the opposite
    site, in Western Australia, while the GBR is in the East. So, choose a direction!</p>
