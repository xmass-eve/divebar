<h2>The Great Barrier Reef</h2>
<p>The Great Barrier Reef is located in the Coral Sea, Queensland, Eastern Australia. It is the largest coral reef system of
    the world. It consists of 2.900 separate reefs and 940 islands. The whole reef is around 2.300km/1.400mi long. </p>

<p>A big part of the reef is protected by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and was selected in 1981 as UNESCO World Heritage
    Site. Unfortunately, lately there are big environmental pressures on the reef. There is land-based runoff from farms,
    pollution from mines, Crown-Of-Thorns Starfish try to take over the reef and there is a massive coral bleaching going
    on due to climate change. It is said the reef lost half of its corals since 1985.
    <br>The Queensland government tries to protect the reef and installed the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. They
    try to do as much as they can, but coral bleaching won’t be stopped in a day.</p>
<p>The Reef has a big marine biodiversity. There are whales and dolphins, different types of turtles, dugongs, crocodiles, heaps
    of sharks, rays, seahorses and over 1.500 types of reef fish…. Some species are endemic to the island the live near to.
    Sadly enough, these species became vulnerable and endangered.</p>

<p>Diving the Great Barrier Reef, you can do on day trips from Cairns, or, as the GBR is so big, go on a liveaboard and try
    to see as much as possible. You can dive the reef the whole year round, but most people prefer to go in between July
    and December. After this, there will be more rain. Remember Australia is on the southern hemisphere so the seasons switch.
    Water temperatures are between 23C/73F in winter and 30C/86F in summer. The Minke Whale season runs from June to August
    and the Humpback Whale season from August till November. Coral spawning occurs in October and November.
    <br>Currents and visibility depend on where you are diving. The dive spots further away, so for liveaboards, have better
    vis but can also have stronger currents.</p>


<p>Let’s talk dive sites. One of the most famous one is Cod Hole on Ribbon Reef #10. It got his name after all the Potato Cod/Potato
    Grouper living there. Dive guides feed the fish so the cod got very friendly. They go cute on picture but it, of course,
    raises questions about feeding wild animals and reef management.
    <br>Another good dive on Ribbon Reef is the Snake Pit where you will be surrounded by Olive Sea Snakes.</p>

<p>Diving Heron Island will bring you very close to turtles. There is a resident population of more than 4000. The Green Turtle
    and Loggerhead Turtle use the island for nesting. Around November they hatch and you can see all the little baby turtles
    crawling back to the see.</p>

<p>Osprey Reef is the northern-most reef of the GBR. You can only go there by liveaboard. The most famous dive on the reef is
    the North Horn Shark Feed. Divers will go down and sit on the sand at 12m/39ft while White Tips, Grey Reef Sharks and
    Silky sharks come for dinner. Maybe, if you’re lucky, a Silvertip or Hammerhead will show up.
    <br>Around The Bend is an interesting dive too. Drifting through you can spot sometimes several Mantas as this is a cleaning
    station.</p>
<p>Novice divers are good off at the Whitsundays. Currents are gentle, conditions are easy, it’s great for doing courses. There
    are 74 islands to choose from but most dive centers are on Hamilton Island. Around Bait Reef, there is a good chance
    to see Mantas swirling. </p>
