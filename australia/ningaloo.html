<h2>Ningaloo Reef</h2>
<p>Ningaloo Reef is on the northwest of Australia, around 1200km/750mi north of Perth. The 260km/160mi long reef got the World
    Heritage Site status in 2011 and is protected in the Ningaloo Marine Park since 1987.
    <br>Most of the dive centers are in Exmouth or the family-friendly tourist town Coral Bay, 100 km more south.</p>

<p>Whale Sharks feed on the plankton between March and June and made the reef famous. The most of them are juveniles but having
    an 8m/26ft shark next to you, is already rather overwhelming. Most trips to see them are (expensive) snorkel day trips,
    but you never know you will encounter them while diving!
    <br>During the winter months, you can dive with Manta’s too. In Coral Bay, they even spot this big filter feeders the
    whole year through. From July till November, the Humpbacks are migrating towards Broome, give birth and turn back towards
    Antarctica. Next to Humpbacks, maybe you can spot Orca’s, Minke Whales, Sperm Whales or other different species. Ningaloo
    has 13 regular visiting types of whales and dolphins. Dugongs are also often seen, although the biggest population (+14.000)
    houses in the Shark Bay area, 600km/370mi down south.</p>

<p>The most famous dive site in Ningaloo, is the Exmouth Navy Pier. The pier is still used by the navy, so it is only restricted
    accessible by the public. This and the no-fishing rule makes it a great dive. It has a great variety of marine life and
    because of shallow depth, it is a photographers dream. Wobbegongs, nurse sharks and reef sharks, frog fish, morays, scorpion
    fish and lots of macro life like shrimps, flatworms and nudibranchs are commonly spotted around the pillars.
    <br>At the moment, there is only Dive Ningaloo who is licenced to take you out diving the pier. This makes it expensive.
    Also, bring a photo ID. It is still a naval site.</p>

<p>You can dive Ningaloo the whole year round but bring the right wetsuit. The water temperatures are not that warm. In winter
    it’s a chilly 19C/66F, while in summer you get 27C/80F if you’re lucky. Most people will go in summer. Visibility depends
    on the rain. From November to January it will be lots less. </p>
