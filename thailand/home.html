<h2>Thailand</h2>
<p>Thailand is a known diving country. It has plenty of islands and inlets, the water is warm (between 26C/79F and 30C/86F) and currents are a rare thing.
    Lots of people start their Open Water Course in the backpack areas of Koh Tao because it is
    really cheap. More experienced divers can go on liveaboards and enjoy the Similan islands or the Mergui Archipelago in
    the Andaman Sea.

<p>Diving in Thailand is divided in 2 areas: The Andaman Sea and the Gulf of Thailand. As Thailand has two monsoons, you have
    to plan your trip. Due to weather conditions, diving may be limited to only day trips or it may just not be possible.<br>The
    Andaman Sea, on the West Coast, has the best weather during the northeast monsoon, from October till May. The Gulf of
    Thailand, the East Coast, can be very choppy. During the southwest monsoon, May till October, the West Coast has the
    higher waves and the East Coast is easier to dive. Most liveaboards won’t go out as weather conditions aren’t predictable
    long enough and because islands are closed to tourists.</p>
