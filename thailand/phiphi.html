<h2>Phuket, Koh Phi Phi and Koh Lanta</h2>
<p>Phuket, Koh Phi Phi and Koh Lanta are all in the same area on the West Coast of Thailand. They all follow the same weather
    patterns. Diving is possible the whole year round but during the southwest monsoon, from May till October, diving is
    limited to day trips and to protected dive sites.</p>
