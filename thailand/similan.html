<h2>Similan Islands</h2>
<p>The Similans are a group of 25 islands in the Andaman Sea. They are the best diving area of Thailand and perfect for more
    advanced divers. You can only reach them from on liveaboards, most leaving from Phuket or Khao Lak.</p>
<p>During the southwest monsoon, the islands are closed so there are no diving trips. The weather is too unpredictable and,
    of course, safety goes first. The Thai government also closed the islands to let the underwater fauna and flora recover
    after all the damage done by divers and snorkelers. Fishes are spawning in rainy season so by the time the park opens again, on October
    16, plenty of young colourful reef fish will be around.</p>
