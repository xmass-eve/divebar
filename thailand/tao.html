<h2>Koh Phangan, Koh Tao and Koh Samui</h2>
<p>These three islands are located in the Gulf of Thailand. They are on the East Coast of the country so the best diving season
    is during the southwest monsoon, from May to October. </p>

<p>I am sorry to say but I am not a big fan of learning how to dive on Koh Tao, the number-one backpackers island. There are
    so many dive schools on the island that there is a fierce competition in getting the most students. Prices go down and accommodation
    is included, what is great if you are on a budget, but don’t expect a great course. Instructors will go to big instructor/student
    ratios to earn at least some money to be able to stay. They don’t have time to explain lots or to take you separate,
    if you have some fears. Don’t let your diving experience be ruined by dive centers with a quantity over quality MO. </p>
<p>I am not going to say they are all of poor quality but compared with the Gili Islands in Indonesia, their standards are much
    lower. If you do want to learn how to dive and you are really sitting on your money, then shop around untill you
    find a school you feel comfortable with, that follows the safety standards and has a reasonable amount of students per class. Do not go to the big dive centers… Unless
    you really want to be a paying number.</p>
