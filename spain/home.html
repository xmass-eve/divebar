<h2>Medes Islands</h2>
<p>The Medes Islands, or Illes Medes, are a group of 7 islands on the northeast corner of Spain. They are a small marine reserve
    just in front of L’Estartit, 150km/93mi above Barcelona. Because they are protected, they have a beautiful diversity
    in fauna and flora. Especially groupers love this place but you can also spot some morays, lobsters, jacks, barracuda,
    even seahorses if you’re lucky.</p>

<p>Divers from every level can dive the islands. Some dive sites are more shallow, other ones have pinnacles that go to 53m/175feet
    deep. Currents can be really strong if you come up to far away from the islands or if you dive the pinnacles, but most
    of the sites are rather protected. There can be some good surge though…
    <br>You can dive the islands the whole year through. Water temperatures go from 13C/55F in winter till 24C/75F in summer.</p>
<p>There are two tunnels/caves under the islands, Cova de la Vaca and Cova del Dofi. Bring a torch to be sure and don’t dive
    them if you aren’t sure where you are going. There are also some dive sites along the coast, if you would get tired of
    diving the Marine Park.</p>
<p>We always went diving with La Sirena. They are a very professional dive center with 2 big, fully equipped boats. You can
    stay at their hotel Flamingo, just a short walk away from the harbour.</p>
