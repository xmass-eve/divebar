<h2>Philippines</h2>
<p>The Philippines are a world-known diving country! It was also the first intercontinental trip I ever went on, and I fell
    in love! The seas were beautiful turquoise and the water warm. I saw my first seahorses and frogfish, I learned the joy
    of muck diving, and… I drowned my first camera. That was the only downside on this beautiful holiday of sea and sun.</p>

<p>The Philippines consist of more than 7000 islands. There are so many places where you can go diving. Palawan is famous for
    its wrecks, while Malapasqua has its tresher sharks. Decide what you want to see and book your trip. There is no need
    for liveaboards as everything is close by and the normal diving is just a day trip.</p>
<p>The Philippines are a tropical country and are prone to typhoons. From May to October, it’s rainy season and there is a good
    chance for a tropical storm. Diving will be limited or stopped during these periods, so be aware when booking your trips.</p>
