<h2>Puerto Galero, Mindoro</h2>
<p>Puerto Galera is a dive city on Mindoro Island, South of Manilla. I visited it years ago and I loved it! We were there in May, so the water
    was very warm. It also meant: no sharks. Butâ€¦ there was tons of great stuff to see! Leaffish, ghostpipe fish, frogfish,
    electric clams. There are some tiny wrecks, there is muck diving and drift diving. You can do and choose whatever you
    want. If you ask nice, you can even go for a day dive trip to Isla Verde.</p>

<p>We stayed with Asia Divers and the El Galleon Beach Resort in Sabang, just outside of PG . The dive center is great, they
    had professional staff that knew what they were doing and there is a good apres-dive bar, but the resort was a bit shabby.<br>Staff
    comes and pick you up at the Manilla airport. After a two-hour drive, you are brought to the resort by boat and you can
    start diving.</p>
<p>I loved the diving for sure but I did not like the town of Sabang. It seemed like my friend and me were the only western
    women around. The rest were all single (?) western men, looking for a friend for the day or for the week. So obvious lots of
    men go there only to get laid. The local women didn't really like to see us walking around too and we got lots
    of angry faces. But again: the diving was superb!</p>
