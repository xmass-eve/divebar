<h2>Bohol</h2>
<p>Bohol is on the rise as a dive destination. People like to combine it with Malapascua and go and dive the reefs and walls around this island. Also, on the nearby Cabilao Island, you can go and spot hammerhead sharks.</p>

<p>The water temperatures flux between 25C/76F in winter and 30C/86F in May. You can dive the whole year through but during the southwest monsoon, in summer, the water will be choppier. Dives can be limited or stopped when a tropical storm comes over. The visibility will go down because of the rainfall.
<br>Currents are slow if you dive around the islands, but you can go for a real drift if you dive in the channels.
<br>The best time of year to see the hammerheads is from December till June, on sunrise or sunset dives.</p>
<p>If you come from Manilla, youâ€™ll want to fly to Tagbilaran, Bohol. From Cebu City, you can take the ferry or the fastboat.</p>
