<h2>Malapascua</h2>
<p>Malapascua is famous for its tresher shark diving! As tresher sharks are deep fish, the dives are made at a good depth. Having
    your Deep and EAN certification is not a bad thing when you want to go and see them. Although the sharks have been spotted
    shallower, you can’t really count on it. You can never count on seeing them anyway, but if you do stay around for a few
    days, you should get lucky at least once.</p>

<p>The treshers like to get cleaned of their parasites early in the morning, so they come up from the deep. It also means you’ll
    have to get up early. It is a unique spectacle in the world so just go for it.</p>
<p>Even if you missed out on the threshers, you won’t go home sad. Malapascua also has nice macro dives. Mandarin fishes, seahorses,
    ghostpipe fish… Plenty of little critters to watch. Go and get the camera out!<br>If you’re still not happy, then you can go and dive on 3 close by wrecks.</p>
<p>You reach Malapascua by flying to Cebu. The dive center will come and pick you up and will bring you to the island.<br>You
    can dive all year around but be aware of the tropical storms during summer. In winter the visibility goes down but
    you’ll get more mantas instead. Also be aware that sharks don’t like hot water, so maybe May wouldn’t be the best month
    to go…</p>
