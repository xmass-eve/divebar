<h2>Coron, Palawan</h2>
<p>Coron is a part of the Palawan province and is world-famous for its wreck diving! It all started on September 24, 1944, when
    a US squadron destroyed 24 Japanese warships in the Bay of Coron. When scuba diving became a popular sport, some of them
    got discovered and are now frequently dived on.</p>

<p>The ships are still in very good condition. You can see the artillery, the cabins, the guard rails and all the diverse marine
    life living on the wrecks. Even as an Open Water Diver, you can go and dive the sunken ships, but be aware of your depth.
    They are all kinda shallow, but as an Advanced or EAN diver, you have much more possibilities. You can enter several
    wrecks with a good guide and if you aren’t scared fast. Coron is of course a great destination to do your wreck specialty
    too!

<p>If you’re tired of seeing all these manmade reefs, you can go and dive Barracuda Lake or the Cathedral!</p>
<p>You can dive in Coron the whole year round. During rainy season, in summer, you have to be aware that diving can be limited
    or stopped because of the rainfall or tropical storms coming over. Also, visibility will be less.</p>
<p>If you want to get to Coron from Manilla, you fly onto the Francisco B. Reyes Airport. There your dive center will pick you
    up. Travelling directly from Cebu is not possible anymore. You will have to take a layover in Manilla.</p>
