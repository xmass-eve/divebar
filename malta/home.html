<h2>The Maltese Islands</h2>
<p>There are almost no good dive areas in the Mediterranean. I know people do their Open Water Courses in Greece or Croatia,
    but there is nothing to see. For more experienced divers, it’s boring as hell. Only one of the recommended places for
    interesting diving in this middle sea are Malta, Gozo and the tiny Comino, three neighbouring islands south of Sicily.</p>

<p>The Maltese islands have different types of diving: Gentle slopes to steep walls, it has great wrecks and some more difficult
    caves for the tec divers. Although you won’t see the big giants passing by, you will still find more than enough divers
    Mediterranean marine life: octopus, morays, bream, groupers… Barracudas sometimes. And if you search good, maybe some
    seahorses in summertime.</p>
<p>The visibility is usually great around the islands, 30m/100ft and above. Dives are done from shore or from a boat. Sometimes
    you do have to swim out for a while before you are on top of the wreck, or climb down a rocky shoreline before you reach
    to water. The water temperature goes from 15C/59F in January to 26C/79F in August so yes, you can dive the whole year
    trough. Currents depend on where and when you are diving.</p>
