<h2>Aruba</h2>
<p>Aruba is the western-most island of the Netherlands Antilles. Its capital is Oranjestad, the city where you fly in and out
    from.</p>

<p>Aruba has lots of wrecks. Most can be dived on by all level divers. They lie in places with gentle currents and are kinda
    shallow. The most spectacular one is the Antilla, a 122m/400ft German freighter that was scuttled in 1941. The captain
    rather sank his ship than let it be confiscated.
    <br>Other good wrecks are the Pedernales, a sunk oil tanker, and the Jane C, a freighter but there are many more. You
    can also dive 2 airplanes, a S-11 and DC-3, in front of Renaissance Island.
    <br>Logical, lots of people do their Wreck Specialty on this island.</p>
<p>Aruba is also home to 4 types of sea turtles. The Leatherbacks, Loggerheads, Hawksbills and Green Turtles nest on the island.
    Between May and November, the eggs hatch and return to sea. You can spot these endangered creatures while diving. Please,
    never ever touch them or harass them! Not on the beach and not while diving.</p>
<p>You can dive Aruba the whole year round. Water temperature varies in between 26C/79F and 30C/86F. Visibility stays good,
    from 15m/45ft to 30m/100ft. June to October is hurricane season in the area but Aruba is just below it, so it wonâ€™t be
    lots affected. April to June has the calmest weather, from December to March it is rainy season.</p>
