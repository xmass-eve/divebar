<h2>Bonaire</h2>
<p>Bonaire is the eastern island of the Leeward Antilles. It is known for having some of the best shore diving spots in the
    world.</p>

<p>Bonaire is surrounded by beautiful coral reefs, forming the Bonaire National Marine Park. Because the ABC Islands are not
    in hurricane territory, those reefs are still mostly unharmed by storms and give place to more than 350 types of fish
    and 57 species of hard and soft coral.
    <br>The bleaching of coral is still close to nothing and the government tries to protect the coral in every way possible.
    The shore dives even have entry and exit places so you wouldn’t step on the precious coral.
    <br>Every diver entering the Marine Park needs to pay a $25/year fee. There are strict rules which will be explained
    in an orientation video.</p>
<p>There are 86 dive sites from which 54 are shore dives. Almost everywhere, you can just walk in the water and start diving
    a reef. Popular is the “Drive&Dive”. You rent a car with gear and tanks, drive up to the dive spot, marked by a yellow
    flag or stone, and start diving. There are also Drive Thru Fill Stations, places where you swap your one tank for another
    and drive further to your next dive adventure.</p>

<p>The dive locations are separated in zones. The sites in the north of the island are in the Washington Slagbaai National Park.
    The dives spots in front of the capital Kralendijk, on central Bonaire, are called the House Reef Dive Sites. They are
    in front of the houses and hotels. You can almost walk out of your room, directly onto the reef.
    <br>Lac Bay is a shallow lagoon on the southeast of the island. The north of the turquoise bay has a mangrove forest
    while the east is bordered by a coral reef.
    <br>The south of Bonaire has beautiful saltpans and hundreds of flamingos waiting for you when you come out of the sea.
    <br>Klein Bonaire is a small island, 800m/0.5mi west of Kralendijk. It’s the only place where you need to take a boat
    to go diving. To protect the coral, all boats need to anchor on buoys. There is no shore diving on the island. Klein
    Bonaire is famous for its Seahorses and Turtles. Loggerheads, Hawksbills and Green Turtles are protected and monitored.
    Please, don’ touch or harass the animals while diving, snorkelling or being on the beach.</p>

<p>Bonaire has some wrecks but they are deeper or lesser reachable than the sunken ships of Aruba. Still, there are some and
    a very popular one, is the Hilma Hooker. The story of this ship reads like a modern fairy-tale. The Hilma Hooker was
    a freighter, used for smuggling whatever what was necessary, people, alcohol or drugs. In April 1984, it got into trouble
    before Bonaire. The law enforcement didn’t really trust what was happening and the ship got towed into port. The authorities
    found more than 12 tons/26.500lb of marihuana. They wanted to wait for the owner to come forward, explain what happened
    and claim the ship back but the dive schools wanted a wreck. The ship was docked outside the harbour still waiting for
    the owner when it suddenly sank with everything still inside. The pumps stopped working and in 2 minutes the ship was
    at the bottom of the sea. Local legends say this sinking got a little help of some divers…</p>
<p>You can dive Bonaire whenever you want. Rainy season is from November till March but that doesn’t mean much. The seas are
    calmest between June and September. Water temperatures are between 25C/77F and 29C/84F. The average visibility is 30m/100ft.
    <br>Don’t expect to find the big stuff. There are not enough currents for sharks and mantas. But you’ll encounter the
    cute seahorses and frogfish, colourful nudibranchs, eagle rays and turtles.</p>
