<h2>the ABC Islands</h2>
<p>The ABC islands are Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao. They are the three furthest west islands of the Leeward Antilles, located
    north of Venezuela in the Caribbean Sea. The ABC’s are still part of The Netherlands but they don’t belong to the EU.</p>

<p>You can visit one of the islands to go diving, or you can island-hop and try get the best of all. If you do stay on one island,
    then lots of the time you do a ‘drive&dive’. As most of the dive sites are easy accessible from the shore, you drive
    up yourself. With a pick-up truck, you go to your dive site, marked by a yellow flag, and you go diving. Easy Peasy…</p>
<p>There are not a lot of currents around the islands. They are an easy spot for starting your diving career.</p>
