<h2>Curacao</h2>
<p>Curacao is the middle island of the Leeward Antilles. Divewise, it has both what Aruba and Bonaire offer: wrecks and shore
    dives. Most dive shops prefer to do boat dives, but unless diving Mushroom Forest and some others dive sites, you can
    always get there from shore.
    <br>If you’re diving without a guide, you are recommended to take an SMB. Almost all diving is done on the calmer westside
    of the island.

<p>A popular dive spot is the Superior Producer Wreck. It sank in 1977 just outside of the harbour of Willemstad, Curacao’s
    capital. The freighter was overloaded with clothes and alcohol for the upcoming Christmas season. The seas were rough
    and the cargo started shifting, taking the ship down. People on shore were very happy. They all got new t-shirts and
    pants and were very drunk the next couple of days…
    <br>The ship lies just outside of the cruise ship harbour. No dive boats are allowed to anchor on the mooring. You have
    to swim out for a couple of minutes before reaching the wreck. Diving is also forbidden when the cruise ships come in
    and out. Currents can be strong and it is a fairly deep wreck. Only more experienced divers should go and check the ship
    out.
</p>
<p>Another popular site is Mushroom Forest. The movement of the waves made the coral erode at the bottom, shaping them all like
    mushrooms, hence the name. Now this cover creates a good home or hiding place for lots of marine animals like morays
    and wrasses.</p>
<p>Curacao has a rainy season from December till March, with some short daily shatters. The trade winds are also a bit harder
    this time of year. It is low season so diving and accommodation are a lot cheaper. Water temperatures range between 26C/79F
    and 30C/86F. Visibility is always good with an average from 25m/80ft.
