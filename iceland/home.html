<h2>The Silfra Crack</h2>
<p>Iceland and diving doesn’t seem to be a great combination, right? Who would willingly jump into ice-cold water, even with
    a dry suit on? Well, maybe you’ll think twice about it as Iceland does have a very special bucket list dive: The Silfra
    Crack, or the Silfra Fissure!</p>

<p>The Silfra Crack is a rift in Þingvellir National Park, formed between the Eurasian plate and the North American plate. If
    you dive in it, you can touch two continents on the same time. It is a very rare geological opportunity.
    <br>Also, the visibility is incredible. The water comes from a glacier further north and can give a vis up to 100m/330ft.
    Only disadvantage is the really cold water. You do need to dive it in a dry suit. Water temperatures are only around
    2-4C/36-40F. You can dive the crack the whole year round.</p>
<p>There are 4 dive sites in the crack: Silfra Big Crack, Silfra Hall, Silfra Cathedral, and Silfra Lagoon. They are not all
    that long and that deep, mostly between 7 and 12m/ 23 and40ft, although one is a technical site with depth till 63m/207ft.
