<h2>Mergui Archipelago</h2>
<p>These islands are part of Burma but lots of liveaboards leave from Ranong or Khao Lak, Thailand. They are located in the
    Andaman Sea, on the Burmese West Coast, what means that there is only diving during the October-May monsoon season.</p>
<p>There are not many divers going this direction. The Burmese Government only opened the islands to tourists in the late 1990.
    Lesser divers, lesser destruction, way to go, no? </p>
