<h2>Belize</h2>
<p>Belize is a really small country on the east coast of Central America. It’s just under the Cancun, Mexico, diving area. They
    share the same stretch of water, the Caribbean Sea, although Belize has a bigger marine biodiversity. The centrepieces
    are Mantas, Whale Sharks, Bull Sharks, Hammerheads, Tiger Sharks, Loggerhead turtles and Leatherbacks.</p>

<p>Belize became famous as a diving destination because of its Blue Hole. There are only three blue holes in the world (Belize,
    the Bahamas, and Dahab, Egypt) so that gives the country a big plus. Diving the Blue Hole is a must-do if you are around.
    But Belize has so much more to offer. It has a big barrier reef, known as the longest stretch of coral in the Western
    Hemisphere. Belize is also home to three atolls: Turneffe Atoll, Lighthouse Reef and Glovers Reef. </p>
<p>All the dive areas are suitable for beginner divers and more experience divers. Especially Lighthouse Reef, that also offers
    the Blue Hole, has steep drop-offs and can be much enjoyed at deeper depths. It has one of the best wall dives in the
    world on Half Moon Caye. You are likely to see the big pelagics that come up from the nutrient rich waters, on this atoll.
    <br>Turneffe Atoll consists of mangrove forests so it is home for the juveniles but also sharks, rays, dolphins, loggerhead
    turtles and maybe even manatees can show up… Ambergris Caye, a marine reserve in the North, is also home to mangroves
    and lagoons. </p>
<p>You can dive Belize from on a liveaboard and visit all the interesting dive sites, or you choose an atoll and go day diving
    at lesser busy spots. Whatever you do, you won’t be disappointed! </p>
<p>Water temperatures are warm the whole year trough, between 26C/79F and 30C/86F. Visibility is mostly good and currents depend
    on where you are diving. So where you will stay and when you will go, is just completely up to you. There is nothing
    recommended as it all has his advantages. Just remember: whale shark season is from March till May.</p>
