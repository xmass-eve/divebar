            <h2>Indonesia, the land of the many</h2>
            <p>I am really biased about Indonesia. I worked there for several years as a dive instructor and I have been diving
                lots in this beautiful country. From great diving areas to start diving to terrific spots for experienced
                divers, from macro life to big pelagics... Indonesia has it all! The country lies in the coral triangle.
                That`s inbetween the Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean. Its has warm and cold waters mixing, what gives great
                coral reefs but can also give stronger currents.</p>

                <p>Gili Trawangan, Gili Air and Gili Meno are three little islands in the Lombok Channel, between Bali and Lombok.
                They are easy reachable by fast boat. The Gilis are in my opinion one of the best places around the world
                to do courses. It's an ideal place to start your Open Water Certificate, up to finishing your skills and
                becoming a dive master or dive Instructor. There is the choice to go to a PADI school or an SSI school. Lately,
                there are more and more dive schools teaching sidemount and technical diving too.</p>

                <h3>Gili Islands</h3>
                <p>Gili Trawangan, Gili Air and Gili Meno are three little islands in the Lombok Channel, between Bali and Lombok.
                They are easy reachable by fast boat. The Gilis are in my opinion one of the best places around the world
                to do courses. It's an ideal place to start your Open Water Certificate, up to finishing your skills and
                becoming a dive master or dive Instructor. There is the choice to go to a PADI school or an SSI school. Lately,
                there are more and more dive schools teaching sidemount and technical diving too.</p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="turtle3.jpg" alt="green turtle" />
                </div>
                <p>The water around the Gilis has a clear visibility up to 30 metres/100 feet. The temperatures are warm, between
                    27C/80F and 30C/86F and the conditions go from no current to a slight medium. The best weather on the islands
                    is from may tot beginning november. But do bear in mind that in july and august the islands will be packed
                    with tourists! Check the month of Ramadhan before you go! Not that the fasting will effect the diving much,
                    it will be more the daily life after.</p>
                <p>You choose an island on what you want to do in the evening. Gili Trawangan has lots of bars and restaurants,
                    Gili Meno has only a few, and Gili Air is hanging in between. We always say that party people and the backpackers
                    are best of on Gili Trawangan, honeymooners should go to Gili Meno, as their is nothing to do, and people
                    with kids can find their way on Gili Air.</p>
                <p>When choosing a dive school, go to Manta Dive on Gili Air or Gili Trawangan. It is one of the oldest dive schools
                    around and there is always lots of fun. Even the Loney Planet agrees on that one! They have lots of instructors
                    who speak lots of different languages. Almost everybody is trained on the island itself so they know the
                    places and conditions by heart. Even the Loney Planet agrees on that one! If you are looking for the technical
                    site of diving, then I do recommend to go to Blue Marlin Dive on Gili Trawangan. They have the most experience
                    and the best instructors. Do choose your dive school well, as not everybody is part of the GIDA (Gili Island
                    Divers Association). Schools that aren't in the GIDA are more likely to take no notice of safety regulations.</p>
                <p>Diving around the Gili islands is a great experience! Don't expect the big stuff constantly passing by -that
                    doesn't happen everywhere in the world- but sharks and the occasional manta are around. What you will see
                    tons of for sure, are turtles! Hawksbills and green turtles are everywhere around the three islands. Some
                    divespots, like deeper Meno Wall or Air Wall, tend to have more nudibranchs than the other dive sites.</p>

            <div id="lembongancontent" style="display: none;">
                <h3 id="lembongan">Nusa Lembongan</h3>
                <p>Nusa Lembongan and Nusa Penida are two famous dive islands situated in the Lombok Channel, east of Bali. People
                    used to stay on Lembongan and went from there on to the dive spots. Lately, I heard, you can also stay on
                    Penida but the regime will be the same. Anyway, the dive tours are always two-tank trips: leaving in the
                    morning, back by early afternoon. In the afternoon, there can also be a close by one-tank trip</p>
                <div class="image-container">
                    <img src="manta.jpg" alt="manta" />
                </div>
                <p>The corals around the islands are beautiful because there are still not that many divers and because the water
                    temperatures are colder than on the next-door Gilis. They go from 19C/66F to 27C/80F. Currents can be kinda
                    strong so be aware. There is also a known down current at the Crystal Bay dive site. People have gone lost
                    and died there so stay behind your guide!</p>
                <p>The islands are famous because there are two manta cleaning stations (Manta Bay and Secret Manta) and in the
                    right time of year, from July to mid-November, there is a fair chance to see a Mola Mola or Ocean Sunfish.</p>
                <p>I recommend beginners to follow the Open Water Certification (and maybe their advanced too) in the Gilis and
                    then fun dive Lembongan. You`ll already be used to the currents and depths at that point.<br/>Lots of Balinese
                    dive centers take you over on a day tour to Manta Bay and Crystal Bay. If you do have the time, go and stay
                    on Lembongan instead. You`ll have dive guides that know the sites so much better and you`ll dive the sites
                    on less crowded hours. The dive schools are also more professional on the islands.</p>
                <p>I recommend to dive with Two Fish, Big Fish or Blue Corner. Make sure you book in advanced as all the dive schools
                    are not that big. Also be aware that on the holy day of Nyepi, there is no diving allowed. Nothing is allowed
                    on Lembongan, Penida and Bali. The summer months are the busiest months. During rainy season, you`ll almost
                    be alone. In my opinion, the best time to go is May/June and September/October.</p>

            <div id="balicontent" style="display: none;">
            <h3 id="bali">Bali</h3>
            <p>Bali is the most popular Indonesian island. It gathers lots of tourists, surfers and of course, divers. It is
                for sure not the best place to go diving in this country but it is the cheapest one to get to. So there you
                have the reason for the massive amount of foreigners.</p>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="moray.jpg" alt="honycomb moray" />
            </div>
            <p>There are two big dive areas: east-Bali with Padangbai and Amed/Tulamben, and west-Bali with Permuteran. People
                that go to Bali on a diving trip, go and stay in these areas but you can also do a day trip to the eastern
                dive sites out of Kuta or Sanur. It will just take you a very long ride in the car.</p>
            <p>Amed/Tulamben has the most famous dive spot of Bali as it has the Liberty Wreck lying there. The USAT Liberty
                has been torpedoed in 1942 by a Japanese submarine and now lies in very shallow waters. Everybody can dive
                the wreck, your depth depending on your level. Even snorkelers can go and take a look.<br/>Because of this
                limited depth, is it a very popular site. Try to go on different hours, like sunrise or sunset. When you
                are lucky, you will also see the big schools of bumpheads. If you can't find them at the wreck, try to dive
                the Drop Off as a second dive.</p>
            <p>If you stay in the Amed area, you can also go a little bit more to the south and dive around Padangbai. They`ll
                take you to little rocks, like Gili Tepekong, and you'll dive there. Of course this will be a day trip as
                traffic and roads in Bali aren't great.</p>
            <p>Diving around Permuteran will give you another type of creatures. The west has more the macro-diving of the island.
                If you wanna see seahorses, this is the place to be.</p>
            <p>Bali is a year-round destination but bear in mind that there is a sunny season (May-October) and a rainy season
                (November-April). As we get wet while diving, it should't really matter for us but I get people like the
                sun more. Me too, by the way.<br>In July and August, the island is packed. I wouldn't recommend to go in
                that period if you could avoid it. May or Oktober are much better. Bali celebrates the holy day of Nyepi
                in march. Check beforehand when the day will fall as there is nothing allowed on this day of silence. You
                don't want to wake up bad spirits, do you?</p>
