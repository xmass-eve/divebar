<h2>Perhentian Islands</h2>
<p>The Perhentian are islands on the northern east coast of Malaysia, just before the Thai Border. They consist of two main
    islands with some smaller ones around.
    <br>As the islands are in the east, they are affected by the northeast monsoon. From November till March, the islands
    are as good as deserted. Almost all resorts or dive centers will be shut down. The best time for diving is from April
    till October, with a peak in July and August. </p>

<p>Water temperatures flux between 26C/79F and 30C/86F, with an average of 28C/82F. Currents are gentle so the dives are easy.
    Visibility goes from 10 meters/33 feet till 20 metres/66 feet.</p>
<p>Around the islands, you can spot the normal tropical reef fish, turtles and reef sharks. There are some tiny wrecks, like
    sugar wreck and two newly sunk police boats. If you go on a day trip to Redang Island, youâ€™ll have some clearer waters.</p>
<p>There are two ways to get to the Perhentian. You can take the bus from Kuala Lumpur to Kuala Besut and then take the boat
    till the islands. Or you fly to Kota Bharu and take a taxi till the ferry in Kuala Besut.</p>
