<h2>Sipadan and Mabul</h2>
<p>Sipadan and Mabul are small islands in Malaysian Borneo. They are located on the east coast, in the Celebes Sea and are part
    of the coral triangle.</p>

<p>Sipadan is well known in dive midst and is listed as Top Dive Destination of the World. It has a wide biodiversity, still
    beautiful corals and deep drop-offs. Because of this fame, there are some restrictions so the beautiful fauna and flora
    can be protected longer.<br>Everybody diving the island, needs to have a permit. Only 120 people are allowed per day.
    So, book in advance! Even so, on a one-week holiday, not all dives will be made around Sipadan. The most will be on the
    nearby Mabul. Prices are expensive even with the competition under dive centers. I have heard you aren’t allowed to bring
    cameras anymore as lots of people don’t care about anything anymore when taking pictures, but I don’t believe that. Check
    with your dive center.
    <br>Of course, the no-gloves policy rule is implemented too.</p>
<p>One of the best dive sites are the Turtle Cavern and Turtle Tomb, the place where turtles go to die! That is what everyone
    is told but the truth is that the turtles die because they can’t find the way out anymore. So not only dead turtles,
    also lots of live ones (that hopefully will find the exit) are around. These dives are not easy ones as they are in a
    cave. You must have the acquired specialties and level to be able to go.</p>
<p>There is no sleeping possibility in Sipadan. All divers come from resorts on Mabul, 20 minutes by speedboat. This island
    has lesser big stuff, like turtles and sharks, but is more enjoyable for its muck diving. You’ll find frogfish, ghost
    pipe fish and maybe some cool octopuses like the blue-ringed.</p>

<p>A great dive site is the Seaventures Dive Rig, an old oil rig transformed into a dive resort. Not only can you spend the
    night on the rig and watch the beautiful sunset, you can also dive under the platform. On and around the pylons, there
    is a great number of little critters what makes this a very cool macro dive by day and by night!</p>
<p>You can dive Sipadan and Mabul the whole year round. Rainy season runs From October till May so the conditions can be a bit
    rougher. As Mabul is a muck dive area, be aware the visibility could be less too. </p>
<p>If you want to get to Mabul, you have to fly to Tawau from Kuala Lumpur or Singapore. Your dive resort will pick you up and
    bring you to the island.</p>
