<h2>Tioman</h2>
<p>Tioman is the biggest island of the Mersing Marine Park, on the southeast coast of the Malaysian peninsula. It is close to
    Singapore so it gets lots of Singaporean divers and liveaboards as it is their nearest dive area.</p>

<p>The diving season in Tioman runs from February till November. Visibility is best in the beginning and the end of the season.
    It is also the best time to maybe spot some whale sharks and mantas. Visibility goes down during summer but it should
    still be around 10 meters/33 feet. Water temperatures range between 27C/80F and 30C/86F with an average of 29C/84F. Currents
    are gentle so Tioman is a good place to do your Open Water Diver.</p>
<p>Tioman is a big island with different kampungs (villages). Each village has some dive shops. Remember there is only one ATM
    near the airport so even though the dive centers take credit cards, you should bring enough cash. Every visitor needs
    to pay a marine park fee.</p>
<p>If you are not visiting on a liveaboard, you should get to Mersing and there take the ferry or the speedboat to the island.
    The boats have a vast schedule, leaving in the morning, coming back in the early afternoon. There are busses from of Kuala
    Lumpur and Singapore to Mersing that have a direct route. </p>
