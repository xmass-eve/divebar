<h2>Marsa Alam</h2>
<p>Marsa Alam, and the whole Southeast of Egypt, are an upcoming tourist and diving destination! Since the international airport
    opened in 2001, more and more divers find their way and underwater exploration became booming business. Most sites are
    not for beginners but for the more experienced diver, although everybody can dive house reefs. Marsa Alam also has one
    of the best dive sites of Egypt, Elphinstone reef, where you maybe can spot Silky Sharks, Hammerheads or an Oceanic White
    Tip! Another great dive site is Dolphin House. I think the name gives the creature away hereâ€¦
    <br>Everywhere in the South of Egypt, there is more change to spot the big stuff like Mantas (May to August), Whale Sharks
    (May and June) or the rare Dugong. </p>

<p>The dive season in Marsa Alam goes the whole year round but as July and August are high season, I recommend October. The
    water temperature is still warm and there are lesser divers. The temperatures are chilly in January/February (23C/F)
    and lots nicer in July/August (30C/86F). Currents can be quite strong so a reef hook and SMB are recommended if you dive
    without guide. Visibility is always good, with sometimes even more than 50m/160 feet. Winds can be stronger in winter.
    If so, the not-protected dive sites may be impossible to do.</p>
<p>Some liveaboards leave from Marsa Alam/Port Ghalib to visit the southern dive areas of Egypt, until the border with Sudan.
    The Brothers, Elphinestone, Daedulus reef and St Johns will be included. Save the money and go. This is one of the best
    liveaboard routes in the world!</p>
