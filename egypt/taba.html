<h2>Taba</h2>
<p>Taba is a city on the Sinai Peninsula, at the northern tip of the Gulf of Aqaba, on the border with Israel. Taba Heights
    lies 20km/12.5mi more to the south. They are newer tourist destinations so dive sites will be more enjoyable and not
    overcrowded like Sharm El Sheikh.</p>
<p>Taba is a good spot to start your Open Water course. The currents are very gentle in different spots. Visibility is always
    good in the Red Sea. Water temperatures go from 20C/68F in winter till 30C/86F in summer.</p>
<p>Pharaoh island is a popular small dive island with 5 sites around. It is in a lagoon and completely protected from waves
    and currents. Another interesting place are the dive sites in The Fjord.</p>
