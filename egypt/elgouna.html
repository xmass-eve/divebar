<h2>El Gouna</h2>
<p>El Gouna is my favourite in Egypt! I have been diving there several times, with family and alone.
    <br>The reason why I like this town so much, is that it has more or less all dives you do from Hurghada but it’s lots
    nicer and safer to go for a walk or for dinner. As a woman alone, I kinda liked that. <br>I always call El Gouna the Disneyland
    of Egypt as it is a created city. It has lots of islands and lagoons, all connected to each other and looks like a little
    Venice in the desert. It is very fake but it is enjoyable. When you come in into town, your car or bus will be fully
    checked at a check-point. Only lately, people started living there full time. </p>

<p>El Gouna is part of the Red Sea Riviera and is located 25km/15.5 miles north of Hurghada. This part of Egypt can have strong
    winds so waves can be funny. The water temperature goes from 16C/60F in winter till 30C/86F in summer.</p>
<p>There are 4 recreational wrecks on an outer reef, Abu Nuhas, 2 hours away from El Gouna. Those ones you won’t go to if you’re diving
    from Hurghada! Because winds can be tricky and the site is rather far away, they won’t always be dived on. The history
    behind these sunken boats is interesting and will nicely be explained on your way over.</p>
<p>Another interesting site is Dolphin House on Shaab El Erg. If you don’t see dolphins during the dive, you will probably meet
    them on your way there. </p>
<p>From El Gouna, you can book little diving trips for 1 or 2 nights up to Ras Mohamed and the Rosalie Moller and Thistlegorm
    wreck next to the Sinai Peninsula. These wrecks are famous and worth going if you have the time. You do have to have
    your advanced level and preferably nitrox too.</p>
<p>I always dived with Easy Diver Academy (EDA) when I was in El Gouna. They have their dive center in the hotel Three Corners
    Rihanna. If you’re not staying in this hotel, they come and pick you up in yours. EDA has great instructors and guides.
    The manager, Serge, will always try to make your diving wishes come true. Some of my family members did their courses
    with EDA and I was happy with that.</p>
