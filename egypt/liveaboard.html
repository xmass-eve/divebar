<p>A popular trip is visiting the wrecks of the North and then go to the Brother Islands. The Thistelgorm, the 4 wrecks of Abu
    Nuhas, the two Brothers and other dive sites are included.</p>
<p>The Brothers, Little Brother and Big Brother, are two islands east of El Quesir. You can only reach them on liveaboards so
    they are still virginal. It’s great diving: Steep drop-offs, an abundance of soft and hard coral, two wrecks, predator
    fish like barracudas and mackerel, and the fiery sharks. Currents can be strong, so be ready to do negative entries.
    Because these dive sites are not that easy, you must be an experienced diver with at least 50 dives. It also is a Marine
    Park, so some extra fees will be included and you have to follow the strict guide lines.</p>
<p>You can also visit the Brothers on a southern trip. Then you combine the islands with Elphinstone and Daedalus Reef, two
    famous dive spots in front of Marsa Alam.</p>
<p>The closer you get to Sudan, the more pristine the dive sites are and the more chance to see Oceanic White tips, Hammerheads,
    Whale Sharks or Mantas. Saint Johns, Fury Shoals and Zabargad are great dive areas but only for the more experienced
    divers!</p>
<p>You can do liveaboard trips the whole year round. Of course, the trips are subject to weather conditions. In winter time
    water will be colder, around 20C/68F. The summer has nice temperatures around 30C/86F. Visibility in the Red Sea is always
    good. Be aware of the strong currents. An SMB and reef hook are not a bad thing to bring.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to bring your camera!</p>
