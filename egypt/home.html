<h2>Egypt</h2>
<p>Egypt is the home destination for lots of European divers that got enough from the cold waters in their country. The Red
    Sea has tropical fish, clear blue water and the temperatures are generally warmer, from 18C/65F in January till 30C/86F
    in July and august. The best time to go is in May or by the end of the year in October or November. The water is still
    warm and there are lesser tourists. </p>

<p>Egypt used to be The African Hotspot for sunseekers. Now, in this political climate, people are afraid to go. Don’t be scared!
    Go instead! First, it’s cheaper and second, there will be more place for you as all the rest stays away. I’d go back
    this second if I could.</p>
<p>Diving in Egypt is divided in three areas: The Sinai Peninsula, with Sharm El Sheikh, Dahab and Taba, the north of the mainland
    with El Gouna, Hurghada and Safaga, and the south with Marsa Alam and El Quesir. Apart from this, there are also two
    liveaboard routes that visit The Brothers and then north to Ras Mohamed and the Thislegorm wreck, or go south to Elphinstone
    and Daedalus Reef.</p>
