<h2>Hurghada</h2>
<p>Hurghada is a big city on the East Coast of Egypt. It’s the second biggest tourist and dive location, after Sharm El Sheikh.
    The city is still growing and expanding, putting in more and more hotels and dive centers. I’d rather go to El Gouna
    25km/15.5 miles up north. </p>

<p>Because of being such a big tourist city, there are lots of people coming to do their Open Water or Advanced Course. On some
    popular dive sites, there can be heaps of boats and divers. I suggest you go in May or October/November to avoid the
    big crowds. Choose your wetsuit well as the water temperatures go from 18C/65F in winter to 30C/86F in summer. Hurghada
    is in a windy part of Egypt. Kitesurfing and windsurfing are also very popular here. Make sure you have a
    good sweater during the boat trips. Seas can also be rocking and sea sickness pills can be a great relief!
    <br>Currents can change between very gentle at the training sites around Giftun, to stronger on the outer reefs. The
    visibility is good all year round.</p>
<p>There are 4 wrecks on Abu Nuhas Reef, 2.5h to the North. Because of this distance and the strong winds, they aren’t that
    much dived on from Hurghada. You have a better chance to go from El Gouna. </p>
<p>Lots of the Red Sea Liveaboards leave from Hurghada. They go up north to Ras Mohamed and the Thistlegorm wreck or
    to the South, sometimes all the way to the Sudanese border. I really recommend these trips to the more experienced divers!</p>
