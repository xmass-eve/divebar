<h2>Sharm El Sheikh</h2>
<p>Sharm El Sheikh is a big city, located on the southern tip of the Sinai Peninsula, just at the beginning of the Gulf of Aqaba.
    It is the biggest and most popular tourist and dive destination of Egypt. So… avoid it unless you go in autumn or spring.</p>

<p>Sharm used to be this little cute town until mass-tourism found its way. Now, the city is so massive, it has two big harbours
    to locate all the (dive)boats. You are never diving alone. Sometimes it looks like diving in a jacuzzi. The bubbles
    from the divers underneath you, make you float up and the safety stops become difficult. It’s diving zoo galore!
    <br>Lately, with this weird political climate and terrorism threats, Sharm should be a bit calmer. People are afraid to visit after
    ISIS shot down a Russian airplane in October 2015. Sharm El Sheikh always has been high on the radar for terrorist attacks.
    It is the biggest tourist city after all.</p>
<p>In 2010, a series of shark attacks made people scared too. I wasn’t surprised about those attacks. It is known that snorkel
    and dive operators feed the fish and sharks in Sharm. I have seen it happen with the big napoleon wrasse, living on Yolanda
    Reef. That fish became upset if you didn’t have eggs with you, so used it was to be being fed by dive guides. The worst
    was when the government just killed a random shark, saying that one was the culprit so people would shut up.</p>
<p>The dive sites are separated in 3 areas. The Straits of Tiran are up north, Ras Mohamed Marine Park is down south and then
    there are some dive sites just in front of the city. A special trip to the world-famous wreck of the Thistlegorm can
    be arranged too.</p>
<p>Ras Mohamed has become way too famous and during high season it is packed with day people coming from Sharm El Sheikh. You’d
    be better of staying in a dive camp and have the lonely hours to yourself to dive.</p>
<p>You can dive the whole year in Sharm. Water temperatures are around 21C/70F in winter to a nice 30C/86F in summer. Currents
    depend on where you are diving, going from gentle to a good medium. Visibility is always good in the Red Sea.</p>
