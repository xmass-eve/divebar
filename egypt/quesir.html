<h2>El Quesir</h2>
<p>El Quesir is an old town on the southeast coast of mainland Egypt. It is located around 100km/62 miles north of Marsa Alam,
    so you fly on this city when you come in. Only recently it became a tourist town so it is still very relaxed.</p>

<p>El Quesir has different kind of dive sites, like reefs and wrecks, even some caves for the more experienced diver. The South
    of Egypt has a bigger chance for seeing the Oceanic White tips, mantas and whale sharks! If you are really lucky, then
    maybe you can even see a dugong.
    <br>Water temperatures go from 20C/68F in winter till 28C/82F in summer. Currents can vary between almost none and strong.
    The visibility is good, around 25m/82feet.</p>
