<h2>Dahab</h2>
<p>Dahab is a town on the Sinai Peninsula, at the Gulf of Aqaba. It is famous for its technical diving and the Blue Hole! You
    can stay in Dahab, or you can do a day trip from Sharm El Sheikh.</p>

<p>Blue Holes are big diving attractions. There are only three in the world: Dahab, the Bahamas and Belize. This one, however,
    has a bad reputation as being the deadliest dive site in the world. It has The Diver’s Cemetery as a nickname, and yes,
    next to the place of entry, there is a wall with all the names of the drowned divers. They get stuck in the tunnel, called
    ‘The Arch’ that goes from the Blue Hole into the Red Sea, they died of narcosis or of panic attacks… It is a deep swim through so
    you shouldn’t just attempt it, if you don’t have the right level and gear.</p>
<p>I wasn’t a big fan of the Blue Hole. There was nothing to see, except a hole that goes 120 meters/400 feet deep. But it is
    a signature dive so you have to do it one day, no?</p>
<p>Another known dive in Dahab is The Bells. People like to start in The Bells and come up in the Blue Hole. As it is on the
    outer side, you have to watch out for the current. </p>
<p>Water temperatures change between a chilly 20C/68F in winter and a nice 28C/82F in summer. Take the right wetsuit!</p>
