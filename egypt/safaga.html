<h2>Safaga</h2>
<p>Safaga is a town on the East Coast of Egypt, 55km/33mi under Hurghada. It is part of the Red Sea Riviera and is becoming
    more and more popular for water sports. It has stronger winds so wind surfers and kite surfers feel at home. It is also
    a good and still relaxed diving area.</p>

<p>One of the most popular dive sites is the MV Salem Express wreck, a burial ground for almost 500 people. Some people claim
    the ship was overcrowded when it sank and more than 1500 people died. The ferry ran into a reef during a nightly comeback
    from Jeddah. Lots of pilgrims were aboard, coming back from the Hadj and many couldn’t swim. Most of the bodies have
    been recovered but stories go there are still some people inside.
    <br>If you swim around the wreck, you can find plates, transistor radios, suitcases… lying down in the sand. At the stern,
    at 30m/100ft, there is a big hole where you can enter. Cars and luggage are still there. At this point, I don’t know
    if you are allowed (and if it’s possible) to enter the rest of the ship. Different reports go around: are the holes welded
    together, yes or no? Does the government let you enter, yes or no? When I was there, in 2008, we were not allowed to
    go in. In my opinion, you shouldn’t enter anyway as this is a grave for lots of people.</p>
<p>My other favourite dives were Middle Reef, with beautiful coral gardens, and the Seven Pillars. We dived with Nemo Dive Club,
    a Dutch/Belgian run dive center. They were very welcome to fulfil our diving wishes. They also own a small divers’ hotel.
    If you aren’t staying with them, they come and pick you up at your hotel.

<p>Water temperatures change between 22C/72F in winter and 30C/86F in summer. The currents depend on where you are diving. Some
    sites are protected, other ones can be considered as a drift dive. The best months to visit are May/June and October/early
    November.</p>
