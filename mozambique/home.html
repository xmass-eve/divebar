<h2>Tofo</h2>
<p>Tofo is a small town on the East Coast of Mozambique. It lies on a little peninsula surrounded by the Indian Ocean. Water
    temperatures are around 22C/76F in winter and 30C/86F in summer. Be aware that Mozambique is on the Southern Hemisphere
    so summer is November till March. Tofo is great diving for the Big Stuff. That does mean the dive sites are a little
    more difficult, current wise and depth wise. Having your Advanced Open Water and EAN is recommended. Visibility depends,
    but remember that lesser vis means more plankton… and so more plankton eaters!</p>

<p>The Big Stuff include Humpback Whales, Mantas, Whale Sharks, Hammerheads, turtles and dolphins. People come back every year
    to dive with these gentle giants. They just aren’t all there on the same time of year so you’ll have to decide what you
    want to see and book your holiday depending on their time of arrival.</p>
<p>Tofo has some Manta Cleaning stations. These beautiful rays are there the whole year round and sometimes spend to 8 hours
    a day getting cleaned from parasites and shark bite marks. The cleaning dive sites are deeper, up to 30m/100ft. </p>
<p>The Whale Sharks of Tofo are still the juveniles. The availability of the plankton helps them grow and they are happy to
    be around. Lots of scientific studies on Whale Sharks (and Mantas and Whales) are conducted in these areas as their behaviours
    are easy to follow. The Whale Sharks best views are from October till March.</p>
<p>Between June and December, the Humpback Whales and Southern Right Whales show up. The mommies migrate with their calves to
    colder waters to feed. Diving with them is possible if they show up on the dive site but you’ll see them more when travelling
    to or from the dive site.</p>
<p>Dolphins and turtles can be seen the whole year round. Hammerheads, Bow Guitar Sharks, Nurse Sharks, Mobulas, Blue Marlins
    and other pelagics tend to show up whenever they feel like it!</p>
