<h2>Hawaii</h2>
<p>Hawaii is the 50th state of the USA. The Aloha State lies in the Pacific Ocean and is the only one not part of the North-American
    continent. No, Hawaii is in fact the northernmost group of the Polynesian islands in Oceania.
    <br>There are 137 volcanic islands in the Hawaii archipelago but most people only visit one of the 8 main islands: Niʻihau,
    Kauaʻi, Oʻahu (with Honolulu), Molokaʻi, Lānaʻi, Kahoʻolawe, Maui, and the Big Island.

<p>Most of the people go to one island and go day diving. There are also some liveaboards trying to give best of all as Hawaii
    is 2400km/1500mi long. Most of them leave from Big Island.
    <br>Hawaii has a tropical climate. That means that you can dive the islands the whole year through, although there is
    rainy (November till March) and sunny season. Water temperatures don’t change that much, going from 23C/74F in winter
    till 27C/80F in September. Visibility is usually great with sometimes, depending on conditions 30m/100ft plus.

<p>Hawaii is volcanic. You’ll find lots of lava flow tunnels, arches, swim-throughs, canyons and caves. Because Hawaii is so
    remote, you will encounter lots of endemic fish. Word goes that 50% of its fish population is only found around the islands.</p>
<p>One of the most interesting dives is the Manta Ray Night Dive in Kailua-Kona, Big Island. Lights are built onto the ocean
    floor attracting lots of plankton and lots of mantas. Prepare to duck away as the mantas will come really close!
    <br>Other popular dive sites on Big Island are Turtle Pinnacle, where green sea turtles get cleaned, or KPC where you
    maybe can see Humpback Whales in the winter months. There are more than 50 dive sites around the island and some sites
    are given different names. Whatever the name, be prepared for some good diving with pelagics and reef fish!
</p>
<p>Lana’i has great cave dives. The two most popular are Cathedral I and II. They both are big underwater caves with holes in
    the ceiling so the blue light can shine in. The caves are filled with fish, like Moorish idols, snappers, moray eels
    and turtles.
    <br>You can stay on Lana’i but most of divers will come to the Cathedrals from Maui, 30 to 45 minutes away by boat. In
    winter you maybe encounter humpback whales on the way over.
