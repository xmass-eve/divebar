<h2>USA</h2>
<p>The USA is a big country with lots of coast. Hence it has lots of good dive spots. Here I will stick to the best three overall
    areas: California, Florida Keys and Hawaii.
    <br>Apart from that, cave divers can find heaven in North-central Florida, you can snorkel or dive with manatees in Crystal
    River, Florida and there is some good liveaboard diving on the Flower Garden Banks of Texas. </p>
