<h2>California</h2>
<p>California, or the Golden State, is the most populous state of the USA. It is located in the West, bordered by the Pacific
    Ocean. California has a long coast but most of the diving is done in SoCal, the southern part of the state.</p>

<p>You can dive the whole year round but most divers like fall and winter most. Sea temperatures at depth (18m/60ft) stay around
    the same amount of degrees, 11C/52F. Only at the surface they change more, from 15C/60F to 22C/72F. It is recommended
    to wear at least a 7mm full wetsuit or dry suit, a hood, gloves and booties. Dives are done from shore or from boats.
    <br>Visibility can change lots. A normal day has a vis of 5m/16ft. It can be worse (3m/10ft) or lots better (15m/50ft).
    Check the tides table. High tide brings better visibility. Around the islands, the vis can be even better.</p>
<p>California diving is world-famous for its kelp forests. Kelp is a brown macro-algae that can grow up to 60cm/2ft a day. They
    form a habitat for many marine mammals and fish, like Seals, Sea Lions, Sea Otters, Horn Sharks, Rock Fish, Garibladi
    and Grey Whales. Wear a divers knife while diving the kelp. You can easily get stuck.</p>
<p>There are 4 main diving areas in SoCal. Around San Diego, you can dive La Jolla Cove Eco Reserve or La Jolla Point. YAs last
    we have Monterey Bay, south of San Francisco and San Jose. Just like the other SoCal diving places, Monterey Bay has
    its kelp forests. Sea otters, harbour seals and elephant seals are inhabitants of the bay. In migrating season, Humpbacks
    and Grey Whales pass by, sometimes followed by Orcas preying on the Grey Whale calves.ou cruise through the kelp forest
    trying to find sea lions or leopard sharks. People that like wrecks more, can go to Wreck Alley. Different ships, some
    sunk intentionally, a fighter aircraft, a NOSC tower and a bridge form artificial reefs. Some of these wrecks are at
    40m/130ft depth, so you need to have your Deep Spec or be a tech diver.</p>

<p>Catalina Island is part of the southern Channel Islands. It lies 35km/22mi to the south-southwest of LA. A roundtrip with
    the ferry from LA to Avalon, the islands biggest city, takes around an hour.
    <br>Catalina has the Avalon Underwater Dive Park, the first non-profit underwater park in the US. In the waters surrounding
    the island, you will see flying fish, the orange Garibaldi, Leopard sharks, Giant Seabass, Seals and Sea Lions. Maybe
    you can spot a Great White too!</p>
<p>The Northern Channel Islands, Santa Barbara, San Miguel, Santa Rosa, Anacapa and Santa Cruz are a National Park. Together,
    they form a National Marine Sanctuary. The “Look but don’t touch” rule is for certain in place. You reach the separate
    islands by boat leaving from Ventura or Oxnard. The islands are surrounded by kelp forests and sea lion rookeries. More
    than 150 boats sunk around the islands but only 25 are discovered and some are diveable. There is also a guardian plane
    wreck near Santa Cruz.
    <br>Migrating whales pass through the islands channels. Grey Whales (winter), Humpback Whales (summer), and the largest
    of them all, the Blue Whales (summer) can be seen.</p>
<p>As last we have Monterey Bay, south of San Francisco and San Jose. Just like the other SoCal diving places, Monterey Bay
    has its kelp forests. Sea otters, harbour seals and elephant seals are inhabitants of the bay. In migrating season, Humpbacks
    and Grey Whales pass by, sometimes followed by Orcas preying on the Grey Whale calves.</p>
