<h2>Florida Keys</h2>
<p>The Florida Keys are a coral island archipelago in the south of Florida. Starting at the end of the Florida Peninsula, 24km/15mi
    under Miami, they go south-southwest until the last -uninhabited- Keys, the Dry Tortugas. There are 1700 islands on the
    Keys, stretching over 195km/120mi, but only few are populated. 43 of the Keys are connected to each other through US
    Highway 1, the Overseas Highway.
    <br>The islands lie along the Florida Strait, dividing the Atlantic Ocean from the Gulf of Mexico. Just offshore you
    can find the Florida Reef, the third biggest barrier reef in the world. The waters surrounding the Keys are part of a
    protected area known as the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.

<p>Diving on the Keys is day diving. You go with a boat or you go from shore. The average visibility is good, unless a hurricane
    just passed. The Florida Keys are in hurricane territory. From June to October, diving can be cancelled because of these
    storms passing by. Apart from avoiding the hurricanes, you can dive the whole year round. Water temperatures ranges from
    21C/ in January to 31C/87F in July and August.</p>
<p>A famous, shallow, dive is The Christ Of The Abyss, a 2.5m/8.5ft statue of Christ near Dry Docks, Key Largo. It is one of
    three made by the Italian sculptor Guido Galletti. It is only in 8m/25ft of water. Divers and snorkelers love to go (free)diving
    around the statue and taking pictures.</p>
<p>The Keys have a good amount of wrecks. The largest one, the 155m/510ft landing ship USS Spiegel Grove, was sunk in 2002.
    Hurricane Dennis did the diving community a big favour and put the ship upright. Now she sits as a massive artificial
    reef giving home to barracudas, goliath groupers and a big school of gobies. You can visit the Spiegel Grove from Key
    Largo, Tavernier or Islamorada. Other famous wrecks are the USCGC Duane and the USCGC Bibb, two coast guard cutters you
    can dive from Key Largo, Islamorada and Tavernier.</p>
<p>Popular reefs are the Molasses Reef and the John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park. They are located in front of Key Largo.
    While diving the reefs, youâ€™ll encounter barracudas, French grunts, blue tangs, goliath groupers and lots of other fish.</p>
