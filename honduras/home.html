<h2>Utila and Roatan</h2>
<p>Honduras is a small country in Central America. The North Coast touches the Caribbean Sea. Here you find the Bay Islands
    with Utila and Roatan. They are the last islands on the Meso-American barrier reef, coming from Cozumel, Mexico, up North.</p>

<p>Utila and Roatan are famous for diving. Not because the diving is so incredible, but because lots of people go there to do
    their courses. You can start from Open Water Diver, the whole way up to Dive Instructor.</p>
<p>Roatan is the bigger island. It has nice resorts, you can rent a car and go around. There is more to do so even non-divers
    won’t get bored. Utila, on the other hand, is more backpackers-style, complete laid-back, just like Koh Tao, Thailand.
    It is also a cheaper than Roatan. </p>
<p>Utila has the Whale Sharks coming over. You can spot them the whole year round but you’re even more likely to see them in
    March and April, and then between October and December. They are the juvenile Whale Sharks, up to 10m/30ft. </p>
<p>You can dive the Bay Islands the whole year trough, although there is a rainy season between October and January. Then, the
    visibility can drop a bit but it’s generally great between 20m/66ft and 50m/165ft. The water temperatures are always
    nice, between 27C/81F and 30C/86F.</p>
